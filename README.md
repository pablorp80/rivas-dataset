## Downloading the data
Download the file `S01.tar.gz`

The data should be in a folder named `S01`. It contains images with the following naming format `S01_CXX_YYY.png` where `XX` denotes the class identifier: ten digits = ten classes, from `01` to `10`. And `YYY` is a consecutive number from 0 to 299 indicating that there are 300 different images per class.
